Windows 10 became the world's most popular OS in recently years. And I am also using it on my Virtual PC in my Macbook (honesty, my Macbook is very slow and not so much softwares that I can use for my work, so I install Windows on my Virtual PC). But, it's pity, the OS is a trial version. So after some months, it became in-actived. I cannot use many features of it, but I don't want to pay so much money for one OS on the Virtual PC, so I searched one free way to active it. 

And, how lucky I am, I already found a best way to active it without install anything (so I can prevent my computer from trojans or virus). I will share with you the steps to do that here.

1. Open this link: [Link](/files/activewin.txt )

2. Copy the code about in to a new text document:

3. Save it as a batch file , name “1click.cmd”

***Note*** : IF you use windows 10, you save it as .bat (named “1click.bat”)


4. Run the batch file as Run as Administrator

Hope can help you.
